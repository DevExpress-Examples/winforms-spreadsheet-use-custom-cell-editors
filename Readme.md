# How to use custom cell editors to create a data entry form


This example demonstrates how to use <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument18170">custom cell editors</a> to create a data entry form that allows end-users to quickly generate invoices. The required data entry fields are marked with an asterisk. To add a new record to the invoice or delete the existing one, an end-user should switch to the <strong>Invoice</strong> tab and click the <strong>Add</strong> or <strong>Remove</strong> button, respectively.

For example, when an end-user selects a customer's name in the Billing Address section, <strong>VLOOKUP</strong> is used to find and display the customer's billing address. In the same way, the <strong>DGET</strong> function is used to automatically display the shipping address based on the customer's name and the selected city of the store to which the order should be delivered.
